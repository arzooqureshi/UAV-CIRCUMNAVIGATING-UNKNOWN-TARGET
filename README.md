# UAV-CIRCUMNAVIGATING-UNKNOWN-TARGET
Circumnavigation is an efficient Unmanned aerial vehicle motion that gathers information
about a target while orbiting around it at a predetermined distance. The
objective of this paper is to first implement a control algorithmthat allows this circumnavigationmission
to be completed in a GPS-denied environment using only range
measurement.Further,cooperative circumnavigation of a stationary as well as moving
target with multiple nonholonomic robots is addressed in this paper.The multi-robot
systemâ€™s goal is to circle the moving target with a specified radius, circular velocity, and
inter-robot angular spacing.
